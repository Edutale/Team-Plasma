# --- ↓↓↓ ISSUES AND FUTURE WORK NOTES ↓↓↓ ---

 * need to fix issue where objects in containers change size relative
 * to container size/ window size. setting width to 
 * {window.innerWidth/8 or whatever number u want}
 * fixes this issue but this method requires to refresh the page after 
 * resizing...? could resort to this if cant find more dynamic solution, 
 * but for now im going to stop banging my head against this wall lol so
 * just look at this in a full window ty

 * also, requiring images or pulling imgs from the const dictionaries dont
 * work fr. worked around this by just importing each asset i used at the
 * top of the jsx but it was still annoying. prob wont be a problem when
 * data is actually being pulled from our db just thought to mention it

 * fyi, quest board function is a little messy cuz i wanted to fill it
 * with mock data to display what it would kinda look like in the 
 * future.
